# Introduction

Understanding the relationship between a nation's form of government and its overall success is crucial in comprehending global dynamics. In this post, we leverage data collection techniques to explore how different government systems impact key economic and health metrics.

## Metrics used

We begin our analysis by examining democracy rankings across different countries. Utilizing data from [Democracy Matrix](https://www.democracymatrix.com/ranking), we compile a list of countries alongside their corresponding democracy index values and classifications. We will then use several sets of date from [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/)
